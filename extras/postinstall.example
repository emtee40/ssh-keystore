# If you want to use this, use `cp extras/postinstall.example ./postinstall`

# Use $INSTALL_FILE to refer to the authorized_keys file.

# I included a couple examples, commented out for you.

# Adding a comment to the authorized_keys file
# You can use the `add_comment` command (a function of the main script) to do this in one command, or you can just echo out to $INSTALL_FILE
#add_comment "# Maybe a nice comment?"
#echo "# Maybe a nice comment?" >> $INSTALL_FILE

# Maybe adding one of the keys in extras
# You can use the `add_extra_key` command (a function of the main script) to do this in one command. This will verify that the extra key in question does exist, then add it to the authorized_keys file.
#add_extra_key extrakey.coltondrg.in


# This lets the user know the script is complete, best not to edit that.
