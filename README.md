# ColtonDRG SSH Keystore

This is a place where I store the id_rsa.pub files for all of my computers. An `authorized_keys` file can easily be generated and installed via the `./install` script.

There is an http copy of these, including a pre-generated `authorized_keys` file at https://security.coltondrg.com/ssh/

# How to use

## Using git

`git clone https://github.com/coltondrg/ssh-keystore`
`./install`

### Updates

`git pull`
`./install`

## Using curl/wget

`wget https://security.coltondrg.com/authroized_keys` or `curl -O https://security.coltondrg.com/authorized_keys`
`cp authorized_keys ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

# Other notes

In the extras directory you'll find keys that are not included in the authorized_keys file generated by the installer script, but are kept here for dexterity anyway.
